What is frprog?
frprog is a programmer written in python for programming an microcontroller of
the FR Family by Fujitsu. It also includes a simple "kernel" (lets name it
"pkernel") for communication to the PC, since the BootROM isn't able to modify
the flash.


Why?
There are only programmers available on Windows.
And Windows sucks, in particular we hate the clickage every time we want to
flash a programm on the board. Sadly we don't have a monkey to do this job for
us.


Usage:
> frprog [target mhx-file]
where the target file must be a vaild MHX output of the Softune linker. frprog
will instruct you through the process then.
(We also build up a simple Makefile which calls their compiler, assembler, ...
through wine, so we actually don't rely on Windows for our work :) Contact
us if you are interested!)


Supported Microcontroller:
o MB91F465X (you find this controller in the "bits pot blue" board by Fujitsu)


Installation:
Do the common trick
> make && sudo make install
to install it. In case, adjust $PREFIX in the Makefile.

For zsh-users, add this to your .zshrc:
> _frprog() {
> 	_files -J files -g '*.(#i)mhx(.)'
> }
> compdef _frprog frprog


ToDo:
o use checksum for transmission
o verify flash
o <insert your idea here>
