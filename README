What is frprog?
frprog is a programmer written in Python for programming a microcontroller of
the FR Family by Fujitsu. It also includes a simple "kernel" (let's name it
"pkernel") for communication to the PC, since the BootROM isn't able to modify
the flash.

Why?
There are only programmers available on Windows.
And Windows sucks, in particular we hate the clickage every time we want to
flash a programm on the board. Sadly we don't have a monkey to do this job for
us.


Usage:
> frprog [target mhx-file]
where the target file must be a valid MHX output of the Softune linker / f2ms
converter. frprog will instruct you through the process then.
(We also built up a simple Makefile which calls their toolchain through wine,
so we actually don't rely on Windows for our work :) Contact us if you are
interested!)


Supported Microcontroller:
o MB91F465X (you find this controller in the "bits pot blue" board by Fujitsu)


Installation:
Do the common trick
> make && sudo make install
to install it. In case, adjust $PREFIX in the Makefile.

For zsh-users, add this to your .zshrc:
> _frprog() {
> 	_files -J files -g '*.(#i)mhx(.)'
> }
> compdef _frprog frprog


ToDo:
o use checksum for transmission
o verify flash
o maybe test/port frprog to other platforms if there's enough interest
o <insert your idea here>

feel free to contribute!

Serial port access is performed via USPP ("Universal Serial Port Python
Library"), a multi-platform Python module written by Isaac Barona (see
http://sites.google.com/site/ibarona/uspp). Thanks for providing such a
comfortable tty interface!

Thanks to Holger Wech for his valuable hints (check out also his featurerich
programmer "FLASHly" http://home.arcor.de/ho/holger.wech/elektronik/ for
Windows)
